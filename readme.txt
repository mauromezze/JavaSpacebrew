Eclipse project of a pure Java (= P5 independent) Spacebrew library.

Adapted from https://github.com/spacebrew/spacebrewP5/archive/master.zip

It relies on the Spacebrew server and two additional libraries
(json4processing.jar and WebSocket.jar), also included in the lib directory.

Some simple exemplary classes are included in the directory 
src/it/liuc/examplesJavaSpacebrew
